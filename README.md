Copy the file in the homeassistant/custom_components/tuya_local/devices/ folder before reloading.

Now you can follow the steps at https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration to add a new device.

At step Two, you should be able to select Karst-400 type of device.

## Customisation

This YAML file is a template that you can modify to your needs. The mapping when you add a device is done with DPs (data points) match so you may need to adapt for other devices.
